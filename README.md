# Punjabi Language Tools

This is a python package for Punjabi programming utilities. This package can be installed via pip:

`pip install punjabi`

Currently, only basic utilities exist including Gurmukhi text cleaning, encoding, and transliteration (Shahmukhi and Devanagari) utils, but more sophisticated laguage procesing tools are planned to be added soon.
